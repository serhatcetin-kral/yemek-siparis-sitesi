<h1 style={h1Style}>ABOUT US.</h1>
<p style={pragrafhStyle}>We are  Quick Delish, a catering hub created  to help those who would like to eat delicious and healthy meals, but don't really have the time to prepare it. At our age, time is very valuable. Unfortunately a day has only 24 hours and there are so many things we want to do. Even more, we are waiting for the weekend to relax and enjoy life, but most of the time, we are just catching up with things we did not finish during the week.  
So, go ahead and enjoy life, relax and spend more time with family and friends and let us cook for you!</p>

<h1 style={h1Style}>OUR MISSION.</h1>
<p style={pragrafhStyle}>Our mission is to provide our clients with fresh, clean, natural products using meats and vegetables from the renowned Lancaster County farms. At the same time, we are committed to finding ways of keeping all our products affordable.</p>


<h1 style={h1Style}>
WHY SHOULD YOU CHOOSE QUICK DELISH?</h1>
<p style={pragrafhStyle}>We are certain that fresh, organic food from the farm is the best food people should eat. We believe that nutrition is paramount to our health and general well being. Usually most people like to choose quality over quantity. Fresh, clean vegetables and meats are very important ingredients we use in our kitchen. 
Just think of water for a minute: ten out of ten times we’ll choose to drink spring or purified water over tap water. So we choose cleaner, better water. Why not think the same when it comes to food? 
Our meats and vegetables are fresh right from the farm with no pesticides, preservatives, antibiotics or growth hormones. All of our meats and soups are cooked from scratch, vacuumed, sealed and flash-frozen for freshness and a great taste. </p>
<h1 style={h1Style}>WHAT’S NEW?</h1>
            <h1 style={h1Style}>Quick Delish X- Press.</h1>

<p style={pragrafhStyle}> We are proud to announce that recently we designed the “Heat & Eat” campaign, a three day meal program, that will provide delicious cooked meats and soups delivered to you, ready to eat in under 15 minutes! Just add a side or two and dinner will be ready in no time!
We will deliver the food to you with Quick Delish X- Press!
